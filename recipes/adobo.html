        <h2>Chicken Adobo</h2>

        <p>It's been called the unofficial national dish of the Philippines. But ask anyone of Filipino heritage how to
            make their beloved chicken adobo, and everyone will give you a different answer. And they're all correct..
        </p>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 4 1/2 Pounds chicken leg</li>
            <li> ¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, crushed</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the chicken, vinegar, water, sugar, soy sauce, bay leaves, crushed peppercorns, onion, and
                garlic in a large pot; stir and bring the mixture to a boil for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and
                cook at a simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken to a large serving platter and set aside. Increase the heat under the pot to medium
                and cook until the liquid reduces by about one-quarter, about 10 minutes. Season with salt; stir the
                coconut milk into the mixture. Cover and cook until the coconut milk appears oily, about 10 minutes.
